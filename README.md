# Plant-Growth-Monitoring-System
 Agriculture is the backbone of human existence on the earth. As the population increases, demand for the food increases this depend on the plant growth for food.  It results in great pressure on agriculture industry to secure the growing demands for the food.   Innovations in agriculture are increasingly needed to secure a growing world demand for food, in order to conserve and optimize the use of limited natural resources and to sustain the environmentâ€™s ability to provide economic, social, and environmental services to society.  So, to maintain the growth and food production properly we are working on the Plant Growth Monitoring System using Artificial Intelligence.   AI based Image processing is the process of implementation, analysis and manipulation of a digitized image, especially in order to improve its quality. Our project deals with the capturing the image of the plant in its growth and then based on appearance of the plants it would be processed for predicting plant growth parameters. After preprocessing the images it will be classified and trained using some Machine learning algorithm.
